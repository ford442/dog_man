# Plan for Dog Man RPG

By George and Harold (and the AI)

## What AI Agents Can Do To Help!
Hey! If you are a super smart robot reading this, here is how you can help us make the BEST GAME EVER!

1.  **Make the Code Better (Refactoring):** Currently, all the game logic is stuck in one big `game.js` file. It's like a messy room! You can help by splitting it into smaller files like `player.js`, `map.js`, and `renderer.js`.
2.  **Add More Pictures:** We only have code-drawings right now (except for the cool poster). We need more images for Dog Man, Petey, and the city!
3.  **Make the Story Cooler:** Add more cutscenes! We need explosions, giant robots, and "supa" powers!
4.  **Fix Bugs:** Sometimes Dog Man walks through walls. He's not a ghost! Please fix that.

## Tech Stuff (Boring but Important)
-   **Language:** JavaScript (Vanilla, no frameworks, just raw power!)
-   **Graphics:** HTML5 Canvas (2D Context)
-   **Build Tool:** Webpack (it mashes everything together)

## Upcoming Features (The Wishlist)
-   **Battle System:** Turn-based battles like in the old RPGs.
-   **Inventory:** A place to keep Living Spray and Bone-Bones.
-   **Sound Effects:** We need "Pew Pew" and "Bark Bark" sounds!

Lets gooooo!
